# Discord-Bot
Work in progress, this is a discord bot I use to get practice coding in python. 

The current version (V1.2: Jan 16, 2020) can:

 - Stimulate a dice rolling with: !roll_dice [number of dice] [number of sides]
 - Stimulates a countdown timer with: !start_countdown [seconds] "[final message to display]"
